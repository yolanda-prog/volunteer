      <h2>What is volunteering?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Volunteering is when you give your time to support an organisation or a community group you care about.
        Volunteers are not paid, but some organisations may help with basic costs, such as transport.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        For people who are new to Australia, volunteering can be a practical way to get involved in the community
        and practise everyday communication.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:22px;">Why volunteer?</h2>
      <p class="small">Volunteering has many benefits.</p>

      <h3>Professional development</h3>
      <p class="small">
        Volunteering helps you learn useful skills for everyday life and work. Different roles involve different tasks.
        This experience can help you prepare for future jobs or training.
      </p>

      <h3>Improve your English skills</h3>
      <p class="small">
        Volunteering gives you chances to talk with other people. Regular communication can help you practise spoken English
        and improve listening skills. You may also become more familiar with local accents and expressions.
      </p>

      <h3>Meet new people and make connections</h3>
      <p class="small">
        Volunteering can help you meet people from different backgrounds. You can make new friends and build connections
        in the local community.
      </p>

      <h3>Experience Australian culture</h3>
      <p class="small">
        By volunteering with local organisations, you can learn how community services and workplaces operate in Australia.
        This helps you understand how people work together in the community.
      </p>

      <h3>Support others and contribute to the community</h3>
      <p class="small">
        Helping others can feel rewarding. Many people find that volunteering helps them feel more connected and involved
        in their community.
